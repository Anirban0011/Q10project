  <h1>History of HTML:</h1>
  <p>
    In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
    prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
    documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
    hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and
    server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
    engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but
    the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from
    1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put
    an encyclopedia first. The first publicly available description of HTML was
    a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim
    Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial,
    relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were
    strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup
    Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements
    still exist in HTML 4. HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to
    interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or
    audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are
    defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced
    by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements
    are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using
    SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages
    such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the
    CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting
    commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually
    format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based
    on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely
    print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has
    been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
